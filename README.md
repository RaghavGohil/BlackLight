*I am trying to implement a game engine in c++ that makes it easier for me to make games in 2D with sdl.

# p.s. 

It's more like I am running away from life when I do stuff like this.. I have a website to create (and a game) and deviations like these never stop.. smh pls.
I have my sem exams coming up too. Next up, after learning sdl, we will design conways game of life without giving a shit about life.
