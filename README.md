* This is a sandbox to try and test the features of sdl to grasp a firm understanding of what's going on behind the scenes.
* As I am learning c++ with this project, I am learning the microsoft naming conventions too. Please research about MS c++ naming conventions.
* functions start with &lt;return type&gt; fn&lt;type&gt;foo();

# p.s. 

It's more like I am running away from life when I do stuff like this.. I have a website to create (and a game) and deviations like these never stop.. smh pls.
I have my sem exams coming up too. Next up, after learning sdl, we will design conways game of life without giving a shit about life.
